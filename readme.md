#rlundo

rlundo grants interactive interpreters magical undo powers!
Some interpreters work without requiring compiling
a new readline library:

    $ python rlundo python
    $ python rlundo ipython

You can undo using ctrl+c

![undo with ctrl+c](http://ballingt.com/assets/undoable_ipython.gif)

The goal is for this to work with any interpreter, as in

    $ python rlundo /usr/bin/irb

![rlundo preview example](http://ballingt.com/assets/rlundopreview.gif)

which will work if you compile the modified readline library with

    cd rlundoable
    make -f Makefileosx

There are three major parts to this project:

* rlundoable - a patch for readline that makes it fork to save state
* rewrite.py - rewinds the terminal state to how it was at the last prompt
* undoableINTERPRETER - alternative scripts for running specific interactive interpreters so that they have undo

##rlundoable

try it with

    $ python rlundo /usr/bin/irb


##rewrite.py

try it with

    $ python rewrite.py

and then in another terminal run

    nc localhost 4242

to save terminal states, and

    nc localhost 4243

to restore previous terminal states

##Running the tests

* clone the repo, create a virtual environment
* pip install nose
* install [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) 1.9a or 2.1 (master). 1.8 is
  too early, 2.0 has a regression.
* `nosetests test` in the root directory
* or try `RLUNDO_USE_EXISTING_TMUX_SESSION=1 nosetests test` while you have a tmux
  session open to watch the tests which use tmux run
